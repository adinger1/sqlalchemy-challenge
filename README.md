When searching dates in the climate app, dates MUST be formatted as yyyy-mm-dd to return valid results. Using only one digit for either the month or day (e.g. 2013-1-20 or 2013-01-2) will NOT return valid results.

Directions are provided in the app to format the URL for searching over date ranges.
